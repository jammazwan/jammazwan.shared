# Jammazwan.shared

This project provides a set of base data feeds in various forms, for other jammazwan projects to consume.

### Use This Project Only As A Dependency:

Do not use this project except when advised to do so by another project.

It has no useful code by itself. It is only meant to be a dependency of another project.

### Why Put Entity Objects (and related) in a Dependency Project?

In that sense, it's like a parent project in maven. Only it is a sibling. Parent projects can quickly weave themselves into a matrix of spaghetti projects, so this just forces things to remain simple and one to one.
